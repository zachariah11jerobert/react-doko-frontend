            First time I used telehealth for menâ€™s health. Doko doctor explained
            me all the treatment options available. I am glad I signed up for
            this service.

            Doctor called me back really fast. Its online, but there is still
            human touch. Care navigator was really amazing.

            As a senior, these are particularly stressful times especially as it
            relates to health and safety. It was reassuring to know I was able
            to get a professional medical diagnosis and treatment that resolved
            my problem. Should I be in need of medical services online I would
            certainly use Doko MD again. Greatly appreciated

            Doko MD service was very fast and helpful. The general physician and
            psychiatrist were very kind and helpful.
